NAME
  pktanon - profile-based traffic anonymizer

SYNOPSIS
	 pktanon [-c profile_file] input_file output_file
	 pktanon [options] [input_file] [output_file]

DESCRIPTION
   Pktanon is a generic framework for network traffic anonymization.
   It aims at enabling wide-spread use of realistic network traces
   by providing fine-grained, profile-based anonymization.
   It can easily be configured by anonymization profiles, which are used to
   define how the network traffic should be made anonymous. Such profiles ensure
   an easy adaptation of the information actually being made anonymous to
   different environments or local legislation.

OPTIONS
  Configuration:
  -c, --config <config_file>    anonymization profile

  Input Parameters:
  -s, --snaplen <number>    read first snaplen bytes from each packet
  				(for both captures and files) [default:256]
  -i, --interface <interface>	    capture packets from this interface

  -p, --no-promiscuous-mode 	do not set interface in promiscuous mode
  -e, --pcap-filter <filter>	filter specification for libpcap
  -r, --use-raw-sockets   	use linux raw sockets instead of libpcap
                         	(-e option is not available)

  Output Parameters:
  -U, --packet-buffered		output (to file) is flushed every N packets
  -n, --network <interface>	send packets to <interface> using libpcap-inject
  				(EXPERIMENTAL)
  -o, --socket <Addr:Port>	send packets to Addr:Port using sockets

  (if '--socket' option is set:)
  -6, --use-ipv6    Use IPv6
  -u, --use-udp     Use UDP

  Miscellaneous:
  -l, --use-libpcap	    use libpcap for file i/o
  -h, --help, --usage	    print this message and exit
  -q, --quiet     Reduce output
  -v, --verbose   Increase output


RUNNING PKTANON
  PktAnon needs a configuration file. Sample configuration files can be found
  in the profiles directory in the distribution. This directory also includes a
  sample network trace. Two included configuration files are
  'profile-identity.xml' and 'profile.xml'. The first configuration copies all
  the fields from original packets into anonymized packets except that packets
  content is cropped. The second configuration anonymizes mac addresses, ip
  addresses, and ports in the packets.

  To anonymize sample trace using sample configuration files run:

    pktanon -c /usr/share/doc/pktanon/examples/profiles/profile-identity.xml profiles/sample.pcap out.pcap

  or

    pktanon -c /usr/share/doc/pktanon/examples/profiles/identity.xml profiles/sample.pcap out.pcap

  The output should look like this:

    -----------------------------------------------
    pktanon --- profile-based traffic anonymization
    -----------------------------------------------
    initializing PktAnon,  configuration =  /usr/share/doc/pktanon/examples/profiles/profile-identity.xml
    istream: opened file profiles/sample.pcap
    ostream: opened output file out.pcap
    initialized
    complete

    statistics for input file 'profiles/sample.pcap'
      processed packets: 9
      errors in packets: 0
      elapsed time:      22us
      Mpps:              0.409

The anonymized trace out.pcap will be created in the root directory of the distribution.
If the output file already exists it will be trimmed and rewritten without any warning.
